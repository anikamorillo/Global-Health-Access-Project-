<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>
Hi! I’m Anika Morillo, a high school student passionate about healthcare and global health equity.
I started the Global Health Access Project (GHAP) to explore how healthcare access differs around the world,
learn from frontline healthcare professionals, and share those insights with others.
Through this project, I hope to raise awareness about global disparities and inspire solutions that improve access for all.
</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>
Growing up, I became interested in medicine and healthcare systems.
I realized that access to quality healthcare is unequal, depending on where someone lives or their resources.
GHAP allows me to combine my research interests with real-world impact, learning from professionals while sharing knowledge globally.
